__How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?__
I'm happy with my progress, everything is making sense. I do sometimes get mixed up with console.log() and what to put in the brackets, but I'm able to correct my mistakes without assistance.
__Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?__
More practice would be nice, but I can also move on.
__What questions do you have about Arrays?__
Maybe confirmation of boolean arrays, I think I wrote correct code, I'm not 100% though.
